# sql-challenge

In this repository you will find a diagram with all the table's connection, the sql code and all the excel files inside of a data section.

-- IMPORTANT: I FILL EACH TABLE BY CLIKING EACH ONE WITH THE RIGHT BUTTON AND USSING DE IMPORT FUNCTION, SO YOU WILL NEED TO DO IT AFTER CREATING THE TABLES TO RUN SUCCESFULLY THE REST OF THE CODE.
